First repository

Hello!

My name is Veronica and I am trying to learn more about coding & Github in particular. I am a librarian. I love hiking and riding bikes and the outdoors in general. I have two cats. I love them and they love me, but they hate one another. I also have three fish, three kids, and a boyfriend who is gorgeous and way too cool for me.
